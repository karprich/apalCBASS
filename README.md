## Heat-tolerant algal symbionts may prevent extirpation of the threatened elkhorn coral, Acropora palmata, in Florida during intensifying marine heatwaves 
by **Richard Karp** and co-authors.

## Abstract

The elkhorn coral, _Acropora palmata_, was historically a major 
reef-building species in the Caribbean, but has suffered devastating 
declines in recent decades. Despite significant restoration efforts in 
Florida, the marine heatwave of 2023 caused severe bleaching and mortality 
to both wild and restored colonies. To understand the disastrous impacts, 
we evaluated the variation in heat tolerance among Florida’s A. palmata 
population prior to the event. In 2022, we used rapid acute heat stress 
assays to assess the thermal tolerance of 172 adult colonies (125 unique 
genets) from four nurseries. We found variation in thermal tolerance 
(4.17<sup>o</sup>C range in ED50) that was attributed to nursery location (17.2% of 
variation), genet (25.9%), and symbiont abundance (15.6%). Algal symbiont 
type, however, was the strongest predictor of thermal performance, with 
the few (n=10) colonies hosting Durusdinium being, on average, 1.9<sup>o</sup>C more 
thermally tolerant than corals hosting Symbiodinium. This difference would 
have decreased the effective heat stress accumulation during the 2023 
event by ~92%. Therefore, despite considerable variation in thermal 
tolerance among Florida’s elkhorn corals, hosting Durusdinium appears to 
be the most effective mechanism for surviving such extreme heat stress. 
These findings suggest that restoration strategies that focus on rearing 
sexually-derived A. palmata recruits with Durusdinium, followed by 
outplanting to suitable environments, may improve survival during future 
heatwaves. Combined with efforts to introduce additional elkhorn diversity 
from populations outside Florida, these approaches may be the most 
effective interventions to promote the continued survival of Florida’s 
elkhorn corals in the face of rapid climate change.
